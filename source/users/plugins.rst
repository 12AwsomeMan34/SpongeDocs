Installing Plugins
==================

What Are Plugins
===============

Plugins are files written in Java by any developer that change the way the server runs, generally adding features.
They allow server-owners to do a lot of modifications, such as adding an economy system, managing teleports and permissions, etc.

Finding Plugins
===============

.. warning::
    Do not download plugins from untrustworthy sources! Malicious plugins can be used to give others unauthorized access to your server or computer.

Installation
============

In order to install plugins, place them into the "mods" folder of your game or server directory.

If your download came in a .zip file, then you may need to extract it to find a .jar file inside.

Common Problems
===============

If you are having problems with a plugin, consider the following things:

* If the plugin compatible with your Minecraft version? While Sponge tries to keep old plugins working, this is sometimes not possible.
* Do you have a new enough Java version? While Sponge is built for Java 6 minimum, some plugins may require newer versions of Java such as 7 or 8.
* Is there a new version of the plugin?
