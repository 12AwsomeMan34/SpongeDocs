======================
Managing the Whitelist
======================

The whitelist allows you to control who can join your server.


When the whitelist function is enabled, only players named on the whitelist will be allowed to login to your server.

  - To enable the whitelist, use ``/whitelist on``
  - To disable the whitelist, use ``/whitelist off``
  - To add a player to the whitelist, use ``/whitelist add playername``
  - To remove a player from the whitelist, use ``/whitelist remove playername``
  - To show all players on the whitelist, use /whitelist list

The whitelist can also be enabled or disabled by editing the :doc:`server-properties` file, although this will only affect the game after server reload or restart.


More information on the whitelist is available at the `Minecraft Wiki <http://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Commands#whitelist>`__.
