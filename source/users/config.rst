=============
Configuration
=============

There are several configuration files that you can use:

server.properties
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Sponge Config
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This will be a file similar in nature to the *bukkit.yml* file used with
CraftBukkit. It will reside in the config folder of the Forge server
root directory. Modification of the properties in this file will change
the way Sponge affects your Minecraft Forge server. Changes in this file
will only affect the Sponge CoreMod, and only after server restart.

The Sponge server properties file - sponge.conf - will use HOCON
(Human-Optimized Config Object Notation). More information about the
HOCON format can be found at
