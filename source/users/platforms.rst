Other Platforms
===============

Sponge, as mentioned previously, provides both an API (a standard, like DVD) as well as one implementation or platform (like a DVD player). However, it's possible to use a different platform for running Sponge plugins.

We do provide a Forge-based platform, but this page details other options.

Glowstone
=========

`Glowstone <http://www.glowstone.net/>`__ is an independently-made server for Minecraft. It does not contain any Minecraft code.

However, at the moment, Glowstone does not yet support the Sponge API but it is planned.
