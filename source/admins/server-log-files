Server log files
================

Minecraft Forge generates a log of server events in the /logs directory of the Forge server root folder.
Logging is handled by log4j2, and the log file will include data from the Sponge coremod. 

A Glowstone implementation of Sponge (if or when it exists) may do this differently.


Including a log file in a bug report
------------------------------------

When you report a bug, it may be necessary to include the relevant log file that contains the error.
Please make sure you find the right one, and upload it to a file sharing service like pastebin or dropbox
so it can be added to a post as a link.
