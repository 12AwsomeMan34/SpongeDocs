Sponge Implementations
======================

So, you perhaps want to take the giant leap and move from a Bukkit
server to Sponge. Here are the options you have for setting up a Sponge
server. The following Guides will walk you through all you need to do to
accomplish this lofty goal.

Sponge as a Forge CoreMod
-------------------------

The First release of a Sponge API Implementation is planned to be a
Forge Server CoreMod.

*The Forge Sponge Implementation is not ready yet, it is still a work in
progress.*

Please note that Sponge is intended to be implemented for *Minecraft
version 1.8* and above. There is no guarantee of backward compatibility
with earlier versions of Minecraft Forge.

How to install Sponge on your Forge server is described in detail at
[[Sponge-Server-Setup\|Sponge Server Setup]]

Sponge as a stand-alone server
------------------------------

There are currently no plans for a stand-alone Sponge API Implementation
(like *Craftbukkit*). Anyone interested in creating such a project is
most welcome to do so.

Sponge as a mod for other servers
---------------------------------

There are currently no plans for a Sponge API implementation for
CanaryMod, Granite, Rainbow, or in fact any other Minecraft server
environment. Anyone interested in starting any of these projects is most
welcome to do so.

The Sponge developers would like to create a Glowstone implementation,
but there are no concrete plans to do so at this point in time.
