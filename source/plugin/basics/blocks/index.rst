===================

Overview
========

What is this about?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It's about blocks. The very foundation of every Minecraft world, the element that makes Minecraft minecraft-y. This section details how information about a block's type and attributes are read and set via the SpongeAPI, what tile entities are and how they can be tamed to behave exactly like you want them to.

Who should read this?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

These pages are intended for plugin developers who seek to directly interact with the static components of the world - the blocks.
