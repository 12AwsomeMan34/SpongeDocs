============

As the name suggests, the `DamageTypes <https://jd.spongepowered.org/4.1.0/org/spongepowered/api/event/cause/entity/damage/DamageTypes.html>`_
class contains all of the categories of damage that an entity can receive, such as fire or fall damage. Although most
of the ``DamageType``\ s are self-explanatory, some require clarification:

* ``FIRE``: Can reflect multiple different kinds of fire-based damage, including standing in fire itself or lava
* ``GENERIC``:
* ``CUSTOM``:
