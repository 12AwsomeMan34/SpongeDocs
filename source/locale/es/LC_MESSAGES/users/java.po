"Java is a computer language used by programmers to develop their software, "
"differing from many other languages in its \"Write Once, Run Anywhere\" "
"capability. This means that any program using Java, such as Minecraft, can "
"run on any Operating System, so long as that computer has hardware powerful "
"enough to run the program. Java is able to run on this wide variety of "
"systems by creating a virtual computer known as the \"Java Virtual "
"Machine\", on which Java programs will run."

"**JRE**: The JRE (Java Runtime Environment) is required to run any Java "
"program on a system, without it, the system cannot create the Java Virtual "

"**32-bit**: 32-bit Java is the most common Java installation, due to it "
"being the default download for most systems. Due to the small maximum RAM "
"allocation of ~1.6 GB, 32-bit is not recommended for anything other than "
"extremely small servers."

msgid ""
"**64-bit**: 64-bit Java, while less commonly installed, has numerous "
"advantages over 32-bit. The amount of memory that can be allocated increases"
" to approximately 3 TB, so you can throw as much memory as your computer has"
" towards your Server. 64-bit Java can also run faster than 32-bit, meaning "
"that you can make the most of your processing power. We recommend 64-bit "
"Java."

"Download and install the latest version of the Java Runtime Environment "
"(JRE) available for your operating system. Sponge (and Minecraft) are built "
"on Java 6, however you are recommended and encouraged to use Java 7. Java 8 "
"does not currently have widespread usage so installing it is not "
"recommended. Oracle Java is a good option for most Operating Systems. If you"
" are running a 64-bit Operating System, use 64-bit Java."
