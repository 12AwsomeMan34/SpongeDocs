"You're probably here because something went wrong with your Sponge server. "
"Let's see if we can figure out what it was, and what to do about it. If you "
"haven't done so already, we recommend reading :doc:`bukkit-compatibility`."

msgid ""
"**Solution**: Download and install the latest version of the  Java Runtime "
"Environment (JRE) available for your operating system. Sponge (and "
"Minecraft) are built on Java 6, however you are recommended and encouraged "
"to use Java 7. Java 8 does not currently have widespread usage so installing"
" it is not recommended. Oracle Java is a good option for most Operating "
"Systems."

msgstr ""

#: ..\..\source\troubleshooting.rst:20
msgid ""
"**Symptoms**: Network connection is very laggy, drops in and out, or absent."
msgstr ""

#: ..\..\source\troubleshooting.rst:23
msgid ""
"**Solutions**: Check your connection to the modem or router. See if your "
"browser has similar troubles. You can use a free service like speedtest.net "
"to check your connection speed. Other services running on your computer or "
"local network may the cause. A DDoS attack will probably completely kill "
"your connectivity, and you should contact your ISP if you believe this to be"
" the case."

msgid "Not enough free memory"
msgstr ""

#: ..\..\source\troubleshooting.rst:33
msgid ""
"**Symptoms**: Server crashes, often accompanied with \"Out of Memory\" "

msgid ""
"**Solutions**: Expand the maximum Perm memory size with the startup argument"
" ``-XX:MaxPermSize=128``. Expand your server heap memory (if possible) with "
"startup arguments eg. ``-Xms1024M`` (1GB starting memory) and ``-Xmx2048M`` "
"(2GB maximum). Monitor your free memory on the computer and see if there is "
"some locked up in other processes. You may need to kill frozen java "
"processes, or restart your machine. Memory leaks sometimes occur with bugs "
"in plugins, which can take time to isolate."

msgid "Malformed config file (eg. bad editing)"
msgstr ""

#: ..\..\source\troubleshooting.rst:47
msgid ""
"**Symptom**: One (or more) plugins refuse to load, or behave in unexpected "
"ways. The server log files will contain messages about unreadable files on "
"startup. The server may crash, and data may be corrupted."
msgstr ""

#: ..\..\source\troubleshooting.rst:52
msgid ""
"**Solution**: Stop the server, and check your edited files. Load backup "
"files of any corrupted data. You may need to delete a config file entirely "
"and allow it to regenerate server startup."

msgid "A plugin (or mod) has malfunctioned"
msgstr ""

#: ..\..\source\troubleshooting.rst:59
msgid ""
"**Symptom**: This could be almost anything - whatever your plugins do, plus "
"the X-factor. Commonly the server crashes with a train of error messages in "
"the server log files."
msgstr ""

#: ..\..\source\troubleshooting.rst:63
msgid ""
"**Solution**: Stop the server, and check to see nothing has been corrupted. "
"Be sure to check that it isn't from an incorrectly edited config file "
"(above). Remove suspect plugins and add them again one by one, restarting "
"the server each time. The problem may originate from one Plugin that is out "
"of date - check for updates. Plugin conflict may also be the cause, having "
"two incompatible plugins."

msgid "Operating System is unstable (eg. Virus infection)"
msgstr ""

#: ..\..\source\troubleshooting.rst:73
msgid ""
"**Symptom**: The server keeps crashing or timing out, and other parts of "
"your operating system are also having problems."
msgstr ""

#: ..\..\source\troubleshooting.rst:76
msgid ""
"**Solution**: Stop everything. Thoroughly check your system and storage "
"devices for malware and viruses. Good tools for this include AdwCleaner, "
"Junkware Removal Tool, MalwareBytes, and most antivirus ware. Check your "
"server files for corruption after a clean restart of your system. Examine "
"the hardware for damage too if the problems persist - eg. a faulty power "
"supply."

msgstr ""

#: ..\..\source\troubleshooting.rst:89
msgid ""
"**Solution**: Load backup files of corrupted data. Software for repairing "
"damaged worlds is available, and missing regions may be regenerated. "
"Investigate the cause of corruption - was it a malformed plugin, database "
"driver, power failure or something else? Always make sure you make regular "
"backups of important data onto a secure device."

msgstr ""

#: ..\..\source\troubleshooting.rst:101
msgid ""
"**Solution**: This wiki is not large enough to encompass the things people "
"may do that will cause software to fail in unpredictable ways. It is always "
"worth thinking long and hard about what you may have done recently that "
"could have affected the smooth running of your server. A memory card may be "
"loose after dusting, a shortcut may be broken..."
