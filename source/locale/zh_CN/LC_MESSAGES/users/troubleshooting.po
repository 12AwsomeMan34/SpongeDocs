"You're probably here because something went wrong with your Sponge server. "
"Let's see if we can figure out what it was, and what to do about it. If you "

"**Solution**: Download and install the latest version of the  Java Runtime "
"Environment (JRE) available for your operating system. Sponge (and "
"Minecraft) are built on Java 6, however you are recommended and encouraged "
"to use Java 7. Java 8 does not currently have widespread usage so installing"
" it is not recommended. Oracle Java is a good option for most Operating "
"Systems."

"**Solutions**: Check your connection to the modem or router. See if your "
"browser has similar troubles. You can use a free service like speedtest.net "
"to check your connection speed. Other services running on your computer or "
"local network may the cause. A DDoS attack will probably completely kill "
"your connectivity, and you should contact your ISP if you believe this to be"
" the case."

"**Solutions**: Expand the maximum Perm memory size with the startup argument"

"startup arguments eg. ``-Xms1024M`` (1GB starting memory) and ``-Xmx2048M`` "
"(2GB maximum). Monitor your free memory on the computer and see if there is "
"some locked up in other processes. You may need to kill frozen java "
"processes, or restart your machine. Memory leaks sometimes occur with bugs "
"in plugins, which can take time to isolate."

"Be sure to check that it isn't from an incorrectly edited config file "
"(above). Remove suspect plugins and add them again one by one, restarting "
