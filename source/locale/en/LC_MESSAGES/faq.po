msgid "What is Sponge?"
msgstr ""

#: ..\..\source\faq.rst:7
msgid ""
"Sponge is a combination of a new API (likely based off of Spout/Flow’s APIs)"
" implemented on top of Forge, with assistance from other parts of "
"Minecraft’s modding community (Glowstone, etc.). It will be both a server "
"and client API, and its target user base is pretty much anyone that wants to"
" mod their game, including server owners. However, we may focus on the "
"server-side portion first. We invite any developer to help out."

msgstr ""

#: ..\..\source\faq.rst:31
msgid ""
"Players should not notice anything different about the servers you know and "

"like before when using bukkit."

msgstr ""

#: ..\..\source\faq.rst:57
msgid ""
"Sponge will be using Java 1.6, which is the minimum version supported by "

msgid "Will players need the Forge client to connect?"
msgstr ""

#: ..\..\source\faq.rst:63
msgid ""
"If Sponge is used on the server, players who join will not need Sponge or "
"Forge installed on their game. You can use Sponge to make management of your"
" server easier, by allowing you to protect areas, log what players (or even "
"friends) do, add minigames, and so on."

msgid "Why not use a \"Wrapper\"-styled API?"
msgstr ""

#: ..\..\source\faq.rst:141
msgid ""
"A wrapper that merely works on network packets and reuses command blocks is "
"extremely limited in function, so plugins would only be able to do a "

msgid "Why not build a standalone server?"
msgstr ""

#: ..\..\source\faq.rst:148
msgid ""
"Reusing existing efforts in the community will allow us to have a working "
"version much quicker. Glowstone, unfortunately, is not free from the EULA as"
" it was not written in a “clean-room” fashion (in the strictest sense of the"
" term). Other implementations are less far along or they do not support "
"Java, which appears to be a major point of contention for a lot of users and"
" developers. None of us have the time to write a new server from scratch, "
"and most of us have already seen Minecraft’s code in some form."
msgstr ""

#: ..\..\source\faq.rst:158
msgid ""
"Doesn’t that mean that we will end up in this same situation again if we use"
" proprietary code?"
msgstr ""

#: ..\..\source\faq.rst:160
msgid ""
"It is to our knowledge and our understanding that Mojang does not wish to "
"stop Minecraft modding, and the recent events have not been directly caused "
"by them. Rather, a contributor (a major one) objected to the use of his "
"code, licensed under GPL, in combination with proprietary code. If we avoid "
"GPL, we will not have this problem. While this does not free us from "
"Mojang’s control, it is to our belief that they support modding and will "
"continue to do so."
msgstr ""

#: ..\..\source\faq.rst:169
msgid "Why not wait for the Official Minecraft API?"
msgstr ""

#: ..\..\source\faq.rst:171
msgid ""
"We are not sure when it will come out. Many people are not in a position to "
"wait. We can get started sooner. Those last three bullet points may have "
"said the same thing. As this new project is community-run, we may be able to"
" push updates quicker than Mojang is able to and react to the needs of the "
"community better. The API may be implemented on other server implementations"
" and we encourage it."

msgid "What license will Sponge be placed under?"

#: ..\..\source\faq.rst:181

msgid "Why not use Bukkit’s API?"
msgstr ""

#: ..\..\source\faq.rst:187
msgid ""
"It contains GPL licensed code, which is the reason why we are in this "
"situation. Recently, at least in the United States, the federal courts found"
" that APIs could be copyrighted, although the case has not been fully "
"resolved. Will the new API be similar to the Bukkit API in how it is used? "
"Events, etc.? Yes. It should be fairly similar, and still afford you more "
"power because you will have access to Forge."
msgstr ""

#: ..\..\source\faq.rst:195
msgid "Why SpoutAPI (+ Flow libs) versus Canary or other APIs?"
msgstr ""

#: ..\..\source\faq.rst:197
msgid ""
"We chose SpoutAPI purely based on the result of the survey (which is "
"mentioned previously). Note, however, we are not implementing SpoutAPI as-"
"is. It will serve as inspiration, which will reduce the amount of time spent"
" on API design. We will also use portions of flow’s libraries from "
"http://github.com/flow."
msgstr ""

#: ..\..\source\faq.rst:204
msgid "What about plugins that access ‘NMS’?"
msgstr ""

#: ..\..\source\faq.rst:206
msgid ""
"You will instead be accessing interfaces through Forge, which has a much "
"greater number of names de-obfuscated. However, accessing “NMS” raises the "
"risk of your plugin breaking as is the case here, but that is your "
"prerogative."

msgstr ""

#: ..\..\source\faq.rst:214
msgid ""
"It will be multi-threaded in the same fashion that is Minecraft is (and also"

msgid "Will you be able to send mods from the server to the client?"
