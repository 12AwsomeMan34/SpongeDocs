"Prior to any plugin-visible states, the plugin loader finds the available "
"plugins, determines if all dependencies are satisfied, and sorts plugins by "
"dependency order. All lifecycle events are given to plugins in this order, "
"such that plugin A containing \"[required-]after:B\" will get each event "
"after plugin B has completed any work it is doing for that state. "
"Additionally, all lifecycle states are global: all plugins visible to each "
"other in any manner must be transitioned through all stages at once."
