"All blocks are of a *base type*. Examples of base types include dirt, "
"stairs, and leaves. However, to further differentiate these base types, each"
" block has set of different properties, of which each can take a limited set"
" of values (i.e. *podzol* dirt, *brick* stairs, *oak* leaves). A block can "
"have multiple properties (such as *east-facing*, *brick* stairs)."

"Some properties, however, are *ephemeral* -- they exist only when the game "
"is running. Their values are not written to the save file because their "
"values can be detected automatically. For example, with Redstone wire, "
"whether they are powered are not can be detected based on the environment "
"(is there a lever that is on?). In this case, the ``power`` property of "
"``minecraft:redstone_wire`` as illustrated above is an ephemeral property."

"As of writing, Minecraft still stores block data to an old format with 12 "
"bits for a base type (4096 possible base types) and 4 bits for \"metadata\" "
"(16 possible values per base type). However, properties do not map directly "
"to metadata due to legacy reasons: for example, the furnace block consists "
"of two base types (currently smelting versus not smelting), each not "
"utilizing their metadata at all. On the other hand, logs do use their "
"metadata fully, but because the combination of properties exceeds 16 "
"possible values (think tree type and direction), logs must be split over two"
" base types."

"Tile entities themselves are Java objects (like a `Chest` class). Normally, "
"Minecraft code would access data in a tile entity by getting its instance "
"and then calling it methods or fields, like a regular object "
"(``world.getTileEntity(position).getInventory()``). When tile entities need "
"to be written to the save file, they are stored in the `NBT format "
