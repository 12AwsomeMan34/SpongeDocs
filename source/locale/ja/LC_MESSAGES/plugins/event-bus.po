"Subscribing is the act of listening to an event. An event handler is what "
"subscribes to an event. Event handlers are assigned a priority that "

"event handlers (such as those from other plugins). For example, an event "
"handler with *EARLY* priority will return before most other event handlers."

"An important note about events in Sponge is that the event bus **supports "
"supertypes**. For example, there's a ``BlockBreakEvent`` that extends a "
"``BlockChangeEvent``. A plugin could subscribe to the ``BlockChangeEvent`` "
"and still receive ``BlockBreakEvent`` events. However, a plugin subscribed "
"to just ``BlockBreakEvent`` would not receive other types of "
"``BlockChangeEvent``."
