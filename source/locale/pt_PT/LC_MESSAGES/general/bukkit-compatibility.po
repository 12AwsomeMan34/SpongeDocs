"Migrating your existing server, or setting up a new one, you want to know "
"what you can keep and what to throw away. Bukkit and Craftbukkit made it "
"easier for you as a Server Admin, and we hope that Sponge will fulfil the "
"same role. However, there are many things that have changed."

"Server Plugins for Sponge must be written to use the Sponge API, or employ "
"some kind of compatibility layer to run (eg. Pore, still a work-in-"
"progress). A large number of Bukkit plugin developers have offered to port "
"their work to Sponge when it is ready. There is an extensive list available "
"on the Sponge Forums."

"Anything that relies on the Bukkit API is a dead duck. Sponge needs a "
"completely blank slate to work with, and will not be implementing the old "
"Bukkit functions as they were. New methods will be developed and made "
