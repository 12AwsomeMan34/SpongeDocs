"At present, the only implementation of Sponge *in development* is as a Forge"
" coremod. Therefore, you must be running a Forge server to use the Sponge "
"API (via Sponge coremod). Forge-compatible mods should be fully functional "
"in this environment, provided they are updated to work with the recommended "
"build of Forge."

"Sponge will initially do very little to your server other than implement a "
"few Bukkit-style commands, unless there are also Sponge Plugins present. "
"Note that Plugins for Sponge should be placed the *mods* folder, much the "
"same as Forge mods. There will be no separate *plugins* folder in a Sponge "
"server setup."

"Unexpected bugs may occur as always, please report them on the Sponge issue "
"tracker so we can fix them. Please make sure that the error isn't caused by "
"an incompatibility between the Forge version and another mod. This can "
"usually be accomplished by removing Sponge and testing again, or by trying "
"out the suspect plugin on its' own in a test-server environment. For more "
"help in finding the source of a server problem, visit :doc:`troubleshooting`"
