"The MIT has been chosen for Sponge in preference to the GPL licence used for"
" Bukkit. The main reason why GPL (GNU Public License) is not favored for "
"Sponge is that it encumbers developers of Sponge Plugins by requiring that "
"they maintain their code in GPL. MIT license phrasing has no reference to "
"the redistribution parameters that exist in the GPL. The philosophy of how "
"GNU based software is designed and distributed is excellent, but in light of"
" the DMCA issues that have befallen on the CraftBukkit community, there is "
"true value in keeping Sponge under the MIT license."

"The bottom line is that a Sponge plugin developer can still own their own "
"software and choose not to release the source code to their plugin and still"
" be in compliance with MIT license. Sponge plugins share memory-in-place "
"with Sponge coremod, and thus if Sponge were under GPL, this would tether "
"Sponge to the Plugin. This subtle point may otherwise be lost on a good "
"portion of the future Sponge plugin developers."

"MIT license (for sake of argument) just keeps Sponge protected, it keeps "
"Sponge plugin developers free to license their plugins anyway they see fit. "
"In other words, GPL is about the freedom of the software (the software is "
"free and freely available). MIT License is about the freedom of the "
"developer, the worker who makes their mark and produces a work that is based"
" on Sponge. The Sponge development team are deliberately erring on the side "
"of granting more freedom to the developer, rather than granting freedom to "
"the software. We hope you agree that's not a bad thing."
