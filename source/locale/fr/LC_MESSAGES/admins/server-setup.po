"In order to run a Sponge server, you must first install the recommended "
"build of Forge Server. This can easily be accomplished by downloading and "
"using the Universal Forge installer from their `download site "
"<http://files.minecraftforge.net/>`__. When Forge installation is complete, "
"you must place the recommended build of the Sponge CoreMod into the server "
"\"mods\" folder. Starting the Forge server will then cause all the relevant "
"server configuration files for Sponge to be generated. At this point, stop "
"the server and edit these files if required."

"On server start-up using the Sponge CoreMod, it will attempt to load all "
"files in the \"mods\" folder. These files must be plugins written "
"specifically for Sponge, using the Sponge API. Bukkit plugins *will not "
"work* unless there as also some kind of functioning third-party "
"compatibility-layer plugin, such as *Pore* (still a work in progress). For "
"information about Bukkit plugins, see :doc:`../bukkit-compatibility`"
