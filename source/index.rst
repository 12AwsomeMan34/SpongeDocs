**Sponge** is an all-new Minecraft modding API created by a team of top
minds in both the server and client modding communities. The Sponge
project welcomes new contributions from players and developers alike.
The Sponge API will have an official Minecraft Forge-based
implementation designed to be an easy-to-use addition to your server.

Sponge will be available for free to both server owners and plugin
developers at the :doc:`downloads`.

*The Sponge API and its Forge implementation are still under development
and not available at this time.*

    If this is your first time here, you probably have a lot of
    questions to ask. We have tried to answer as many as possible in our
    :doc:`faq`. Take a moment to browse it
    before heading onward to the specifics.

Sponge for players
------------------

Will I need to use a Forge client and sponge too?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can log in to a Minecraft Server running Sponge with any Minecraft
Client of the right MC version. It will not require players to have
either Forge or Sponge installed. Minecraft Forge for 1.8 will allow
vanilla clients to connect. Sponge should work much the same as
CraftBukkit did in this respect.

What about my favourite Bukkit plugins?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Server Plugins must be written to use the Sponge API, or employ some
kind of compatibility layer to run (eg. Pore). A large number of Bukkit
plugin developers have offered to port their work to Sponge when it is
ready. For more information, please visit [[Bukkit
Compatibility\|Bukkit-Compatibility]].
