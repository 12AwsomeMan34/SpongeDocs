Sponge Documentation
====================

Welcome to the documentation for `Sponge <http://spongepowered.org>`__! Sponge lets people write self-contained mods for Minecraft that work even across major updates to Minecraft. The project is free to use and open source.

Sponge produces an "API" -- a standard way to write mods. However, the API is like the DVD standard, a DVD player is required to actually play the DVD. In our case, we both define the standard (the Sponge API) as well as provide one way to run Sponge plugins: on top of Minecraft Forge, which some people may already be familiar with.

This documentation is separated into several sections:

* :ref:`user-docs`
* :ref:`plugin-dev-docs`

For people who wish to work on Sponge itself, or build an implementation, there is some documentation for that:

* :ref:`sponge-dev-docs`
