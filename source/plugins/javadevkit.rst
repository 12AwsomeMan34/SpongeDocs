Installing the Java Development Kit (JDK)
=========================================

To develop Sponge plugins and/or work on Sponge itself, you must have the JDK.


Java Development Kit download
-----------------------------

We recommend that you first check that you have only **one** version of Java installed at any point in time.
Please begin by uninstalling any older versions of Java that are present on your computer.


Next, download and run the correct JDK installer for your system. Oracle.com kindly provides free JDK downloads:
- `Java 7 <http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk7-downloads-1880260.html>`__
- `Java 8 <http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html>`__.


When the installation process is complete, reboot your computer. The JDK should now be ready for use.


.. note::
  Java 6 is outdated and not recommended for use in development. Java 8 is also not recommended because it is not yet  widely used.
 
 
.. warning::
  Make sure you install the JDK (Java Development Kit), not the JRE (Java Runtime Environment). The JDK contains crucial tools for creating Java applications.
