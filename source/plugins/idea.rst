- Intellij have a Community and a Ultimate Edition, download the Community Edition unless you have the license/money for the paid version. You can also apply as a student to get it free.
- You do not need the Ultimate Edition to develop plugins, as the Community Version still contains all the tools you need.

Plugins

Like Eclipse, IntelliJ have many built-in plugins that simplify the development of your Sponge plugin.

To install plugins, go to ``File >> Settings >> Plugins...`` and search for your desired plugins.
