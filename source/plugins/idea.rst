Intellij is a development environment that you can learn and code Java (including Sponge plugins). 
*It is recommended that you have some experience with Java before you proceed to writing plugins in Sponge.*

Plugins

Like Eclipse, IntelliJ has many built-in plugins that simplify the development of your Sponge plugin.

To install plugins, go to ``File >> Settings >> Plugins...`` and search for your desired plugins.

Gradle Integration
--------------------------
IntelliJ has built-in support for Gradle, the dependency management and build system used by the Sponge Project and many plugin developers.

Look at the :doc:`gradle` page for more information about setting up a Gradle project.

Git Integration

IntelliJ supports Git. To use the features provided, go to ``VCS >> Enable Version Control Integration``.

To share a project on GitHub, go to ``VCS >> Import into Version Controll >> Share on GitHub``.
