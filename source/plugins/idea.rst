IntelliJ IDEA
=============


You can download IntelliJ IDEA here: https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/


(Choose the "Community Version" unless you want to pay for the Ultimate Edition, or you can get it free as a student.
You do not need the Ultimate Edition to develop plugins, as the Community Version still contains all the tools you need.)
