Installing the JDK
==================

First and foremost, you do need the Java Development Kit (JDK) installed.

Getting Started
===============

You can choose to either start developing plugins by following instructions to set up an IDE or by creating a build script and going from there.

.. note::

    The IDE route is preferred for those who are not familiar with developing in Java.

Starting with an IDE
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

An IDE (integrated development environment) auto-completes names and is recommended for getting started with Sponge, though it is not required.

.. tip::
   
    We provide instructions for both IntelliJ IDEA and Eclipse, but IDEA is recommended over Eclipse.

Starting with a Build Script
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

These instructions illustrate how one can build a build script to compile a Sponge plugin.

.. tip::
   
    We provide instructions for both the Gradle and Maven build systems, but Gradle is easier to get started with, especially on Windows.
