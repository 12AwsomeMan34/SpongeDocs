Installing the JDK
==================

First and foremost, you do need the Java Development Kit (JDK) installed.

Getting Started
===============

You can choose to either start developing plugins by following instructions to set up an IDE or by creating a build script and going from there.

We recommend starting with an IDE if you are not familiar with Java.

Starting with an IDE
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

An IDE (integrated development environment) auto-completes names and is recommended for getting started with Sponge, though it is not required.

We recommend using IntelliJ IDEA.
