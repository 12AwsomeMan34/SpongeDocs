Plugins
~~~~~~~

Eclipse supports many plugins that simplify development tasks, especially for beginners.

To install plugins, go to ``Help >> Install New Software...`` and enter the the update site location.
Alternatively, you can drag the 'Install Button' from the Eclipse marketplace into your running Eclipse instance.

Eclipse Gradle Integration
--------------------------

This plugin adds a visual interface for Gradle, the dependency management and build system used by the Sponge Project and many plugin developers.

Look at the :doc:`gradle` page for more information about setting up a Gradle project.

Usually you do not need the optional Spring modules distributed with this plugin, so you uncheck them during the installation.

**You can download it at:**

Eclipse Git Integration
-----------------------

This plugin provides an interface for the distributed version control system Git, which is also used by the Sponge Project.

**This plugin is already included in the "Eclipse IDE for Java Developers" package.**
