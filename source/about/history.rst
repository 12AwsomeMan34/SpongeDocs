The History of Sponge
=====================

This page is split into two main parts:
 * the history of the project itself
 * the history of our beloved mascot Spongie

The History of the Project
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~



Spongie - our Mascot
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Spongie is our friendly, helpful and somewhat soaky mascot. Don't make her cry,
as she's a very sensitive person.

The History of Spongie
----------------------

Spongie first appeared in #Sponge on Esper.NET around September 2014.
She was created and posted by `DragonsPainter <http://dragonspainter.deviantart.com/>`__.
Strad, another user, felt that Spongie would look better with a moogle like
antenna, a Forge furnace instead of a Cauldron and replaced the Spigot with
Spout. An anonymous user then removed all labels and introduced her as the icon
and background logo for the Sponge reddit section.

This older version of Spongie sadly isn't available as vector graphic.
Thus Sponge staff decided to create a new vectorized version. Two new drafts
were then posted on `State of Spongie <https://forums.spongepowered.org/t/state-of-spongie-wip/6194>`__.

The final decision on Spongie is still pending.
